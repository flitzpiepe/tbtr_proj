STACK
	- test: sell remainders
		? cargo
	- feature: do template replacement
		* tc_0: lots of mixed cargo
		* tc_1: simple replacement, dual-head
		- test in combination with autoreplacement
		- test network sync
			* console command debuglevel has a setting desync
		? reset stats for the old vehicle (neutralize status or somewhere else)
			* copying the stats into the new vehicle is a bit weird, it means that the profit from a vehicle
			  will be doubled because it is also listed for the new one, this should skew some global
			  statistics ...
		- incorporate "SavedRandomSeeds saved_seeds;" from autoreplace_cmd.cpp:713
		? move all to a separate file
		- check all loops and ifs in this file for {} convention
		- both findIn[...] functions (find template in train/depot):
			// TODO bad scenario
			// 	all vehicles have 0 cargo
			// 	one is selected because of correct engine type
			// 	later veh also fits AND has matching refit, too
			// 		--> but will not be selected because its cargo isn't greater than that of the original one
			// TODO should we prefer vehicles with 0 cargo? who knows whether it will fit the vehicle's current orders ...




TODO
	! code TODOs
	- TemplateVehicle::Draw(): refactor params, e.g. 'right' is not even used
	- TemplateVehicle::CalculateCost() might also include the refit cost and maybe more
		? use the command functions to do this simulation
		- cache the total cost in the template itself
			- cached_total_cost
	- template options stored in group instead of template
		* in order to configure each template replacement indiviually, without the need of a new template each
		  time
		- display template replacement options in group row
	- template details are not listed in the gui
	? clone from existing template
		* could be useful when the editing is available or just to set other options
	! delete button doesn't work
		* test case: 0 (UKRS2)
	! main gui is not updated when a new group is created
	- show floating money cost numbers after a replacement
	- test Template->Next() for
		- articulated
		- dual-headed
		? maybe use GetNextUnit() for templates as well
	- use DoCommandP for all user actions initiated from the GUI (OnClick(),...?)
	*** GUI is currently running with this->owner==_local_company
		* watch out for possible side effects because this has never been the case before
	- prevent multiple instances of the tbtr gui
	- check when group + template list are being rebuilt
		* TbtrGui::OnPaint doesn't rebuild the template list but rebuilds the groups list
		* either both should be rebuilt or none
		- check all occurrences of the rebuild funcs and see if they're needed everywhere
	? is it necessary to have the owner specified in the tbtr gui
		* should be always the _local_company
	! add missing documentation
		- also review the comment for the CmdTemplateReplace function
	- templatevehicle: remove or rename the bool methods (getters)
	! group list is not updated when a new group is created
	! dtors not implemented
	- calc # trains that still need replacement + update the main gui accordingly
		* commented code still exists
    - check if Train* clicked is needed in TemplateVehicle::CloneFromTrain()
    ? remove TemplateVehicle::prev
    ? rename all .h -> .hpp
    - remove prev and first from TV
    - modifications in all files in list below
        - check what the old patch modified in each file
	- impl macro: for all templates from->to
		* e.g.: TbtrGui::DrawTemplates
	- untested: warning string for free-wagon-chains
		* because with cloning we cannot create such a template, will need to wait for the edit function
	- see how ..._TMPLRPL_EX_DIFF_RAILTYPE was used in the old code and either reintegrate it or remove it
	  from the lang file
	? is TemplateVehicle::index really necessary
		* might be defined via PoolItem's index already, the TemplatePool is defined with TemplateID as a template parameter
	...
	? deal with parent groups

FUNCTIONALITIES TO INTEGRATE
    - list templates
    - replace all vehicles in template
    - template replacement
    - list template details
    - test TbtrGui::BuildTemplateList()
        *(this->templates.Append()) = tv;
    - tbtrgui should have the owner as member
        - refactor all methods which get an Owner as parameter
    ? needed, maybe rm
        template_vehicle.h : TemplateID FindTemplateIndexForGroup(GroupID);
