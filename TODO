updated:		2015-01-18
next version:	v0.4e

TODO
	- rm/do all TODOs
	- rm all MYGUIs
	- look through patch (branch diff) and remove stupid comments and such
	- rename files + classes (-aaa)
		* includes
	- i++ -> ++i


DONE
	- split patch into patches for each file
	- apply file patches
	- make everything compile again
	- code adaptations:
		+ corrected EngineNumberSorter	
		+ corrected movement of cargo
		+ adapted updateViewport code
	- fixed compiler warnings


LATER
	- code refactoring
		- reuse new class BaseConsist for storing head-related stuff
		- train_cmd.cpp:3748 :: Money calculateOverallValue(veh*)
			* does there exist something like this for the new baseconsist class ?

	? does tmpl rplcmt succeed if the action is to just remove some wagons but there is not enough money for a fully new train

	- when a train is to be extended by adding only a wagon (e.g.), it seems like the cost for a completely new train are
		considered, instead of only the actual update cost, this doesn't make sense
