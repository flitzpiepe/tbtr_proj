TODO
    * real_consist_length has been removed, wasn't used, can be removed when the patch has been
      verified to be functional
        tmp->First()->SetRealLength(CeilDiv(init_clicked->gcache.cached_total_length * 10, TILE_SIZE));
    - check if Train* clicked is needed in TemplateVehicle::CloneFromTrain()
    - TemplateVehicle::(prev|first) are not set, can probably be removed
    ? rename all .h -> .hpp
    - remove prev and first from TV

FUNCTIONALITIES TO INTEGRATE
    - list templates
    - replace all vehicles in template
    - template replacement
    - list template details
    - test TbtrGui::BuildTemplateList()
        *(this->templates.Append()) = tv;
    - tbtrgui should have the owner as member
        - refactor all methods which get an Owner as parameter
    ? needed, maybe rm
        template_vehicle.h : TemplateID FindTemplateIndexForGroup(GroupID);


STACK
    - clone template from train
        * feat/clone_train_to_template
