next version:	v0.4e

TODO
	- look through patch (branch diff) and remove stupid comments and such
	- rename files + classes (-aaa)
		* includes


DONE
	- rm all MYGUIs
	- rm/do all TODOs
	- i++ -> ++i


LATER
	- code refactoring
		- design + impl workflow for editing or creating a template train
			* main gui shall be noticed correctly whenever a template has definitively changed
				- notifying the main gui is done via given the child windows pointers to bools which are set by the child and checked by the parent
			* main gui shall not rebuild the template list until that change has been confirmed
				- currently, the list is being rebuilt constantly
			* will require to reactivate the first line in ...vehicle_func::BuildTemplateGuiList
			* write header file for main gui to allow children to call its specialized functions
		- write header file for TemplateReplaceWindow
			* child windows shall call functions from their parent in order to extract information or notify about progress
			* e.g. create template shall be able to notify about a new template so that the template list can be rebuilt (instead of rebuilding it on every paint event)
		- reuse new class BaseConsist for storing head-related stuff
		- train_cmd.cpp:3748 :: Money calculateOverallValue(veh*)
			* does there exist something like this for the new baseconsist class ?
		- virtual void SetStringParameters(int widget) const;
			* is used to calculate the min window size, should be updated to contain all necessary stuff
		- normalize widget strings
			* the form with enum {lotsa string_ids} is not used anymore (?)
			* copy-paste code doesn't use this consistently either (?)

	- display error message boxes
		* when a template could not be cloned from an existing train
		* when a template could not be cloned from some other tmpl

	- add hotkey for main gui

	- settings entry

	? does tmpl rplcmt succeed if the action is to just remove some wagons but there is not enough money for a fully new train

	- when a train is to be extended by adding only a wagon (e.g.), it seems like the cost for a completely new train are
		considered, instead of only the actual update cost, this doesn't make sense

	- in commit: cadfac9
		* deleted a call to deleteAllTemplateReplacements with param -1 (group id, should be invalid)
	
	- rm debugging functions in _func.cpp
		* pat, pav, ptv, pvt
