STACK
	- update all template values from the selected engine
		- this->engine_type = train->engine_type;
			e->type
		- this->subtype = train->subtype;
		- this->railtype = train->railtype;
		- this->cargo_type = train->cargo_type;
		- this->cargo_subtype = train->cargo_subtype;
		- this->cargo_cap = train->cargo_cap;
		- const GroundVehicleCache* gcache = train->GetGroundVehicleCache();
		- this->max_speed = train->GetDisplayMaxSpeed();
		- this->power = gcache->cached_power;
		- this->weight = gcache->cached_weight;
		- this->max_te = gcache->cached_max_te / 1000;
	- need an (up-to-date) last-pointer on each template to be able to append a new tv
		- add ptr
		- set/upd during clone
		- set during game load
	- add selected engine to a template
		- need to set some values that are normally copied from a train
			- see CloneFromTrain() for a list of values
			- real_length is set in tbtr_template_cmd.cpp:~493
	- new engines widget
		- add button "add engine"
		- either rename MATRIX_NEW_ENGINES or the other 2
		- add a label on top
	- create template
		! articulated parts are not added when an engine is added to a template
			- test: ignore all artic + multiheaded parts
				* branch: test/ignore_artic_parts
				- test: applying a template
				- test: clone a multiheaded train
					* othermultiheadedpart is not included in the template
		- gui components
			- edit selected template or create a new one
			- button: build -> append new template vehicle
			? free drag and drop between existing templates
				? or just for the selected template
			- ensure horiz scrolling for long templates
			! last cell is displayed with double height which snaps into the correct size once the UI is
			  resized
			! engines are left-aligned instead of centered (like in the "new vehicles" gui)
		- ensure template sanity
		- caching of the vehicle sprite width is complicated
			! initialization doesn't work from the ctor and during the drawing loop the tv obj is const...
		- code TODOs



TODO
	- remove tbtr_debug.h includes
	- check the allocation checks when cloning a template from a train
		* tbtr..._cmd.cpp:486 has one check, but this is only for one vehicle
		* there should be more checks when subsequent TVs are created for the rest of the train


LATER
	? why is there no separate header for the cmd functions
	- rename all TRW_WIDGET_TMPL_ elements
	- normalize {} convention for switch-case
	- TemplateVehicle::Draw(): refactor params, e.g. 'right' is not even used
	- autoreplacement: it would be better to still do it if tbtr is impossible, e.g. due to current money
		- allow scheduling of both
		- move tbtr before autorpl in callvehticks
		? prevent autorepl for a train if tbtr succeeded
			* e.g. by removing it from the mapping
	- scheduling of tbtr
		- check if group of train has a template
		- check if train already matches the template
		- autoreplace handles start/stop of the vehicle via CmdStartStopVehicle(), l.708
	- the selected group index should be updated to stick with the current group if another group is added or removed
		- same for the templates list
	- clone from existing template
		? what happens right now when doing this
		* could be useful when the editing is available or just to set other options
    ? all header includes into cpp files
	? template options stored in group instead of template
		* in order to configure each template replacement indiviually, without the need of a new template each
		  time
		- display template replacement options in group row
	- show floating money cost numbers after a replacement
	- TemplateVehicle::CalculateCost() might also include the refit cost and maybe more
		? use the command functions to do this simulation
		- cache the total cost in the template itself
			- cached_total_cost
	*** GUI is currently running with this->owner==_local_company
		* watch out for possible side effects because this has never been the case before
	- prevent multiple instances of the tbtr gui
	- check all loops and ifs in this file for {} convention
	- check for unused functions
	- check when group + template list are being rebuilt
		* TbtrGui::OnPaint doesn't rebuild the template list but rebuilds the groups list
		* either both should be rebuilt or none
		- check all occurrences of the rebuild funcs and see if they're needed everywhere
	? is it necessary to have the owner specified in the tbtr gui
		* should be always the _local_company
	! add missing documentation
		- also review the comment for the CmdTemplateReplace function
	- templatevehicle: remove or rename the bool methods (getters)
	- calc # trains that still need replacement + update the main gui accordingly
		* commented code still exists
    ? remove TemplateVehicle::prev
    ? rename all .h -> .hpp
    - remove prev and first from TV
	- impl macro: for all templates from->to
		* e.g.: TbtrGui::DrawTemplates
	- untested: warning string for free-wagon-chains
		* because with cloning we cannot create such a template, will need to wait for the edit function
	- see how ..._TMPLRPL_EX_DIFF_RAILTYPE was used in the old code and either reintegrate it or remove it
	  from the lang file
	- compute the line_height for the tbtr gui, without this being an external param
	? is TemplateVehicle::index really necessary
		* might be defined via PoolItem's index already, the TemplatePool is defined with TemplateID as a template parameter
	? deal with parent groups
	...

FUNCTIONALITIES TO INTEGRATE
    - list templates
    - replace all vehicles in template
    - template replacement
    - list template details
    - test TbtrGui::BuildTemplateList()
        *(this->templates.Append()) = tv;
    - tbtrgui should have the owner as member
        - refactor all methods which get an Owner as parameter
    ? needed, maybe rm
        template_vehicle.h : TemplateID FindTemplateIndexForGroup(GroupID);
