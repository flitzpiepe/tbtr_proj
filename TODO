updated:		2015-01-25
next version:	v0.4e

TODO
	- rm/do all TODOs
	- look through patch (branch diff) and remove stupid comments and such
	- rename files + classes (-aaa)
		* includes
	- i++ -> ++i


DONE
	- rm all MYGUIs


LATER
	- code refactoring
		- reuse new class BaseConsist for storing head-related stuff
		- train_cmd.cpp:3748 :: Money calculateOverallValue(veh*)
			* does there exist something like this for the new baseconsist class ?
		- virtual void SetStringParameters(int widget) const;
			* is used to calculate the min window size, should be updated to contain all necessary stuff
		- normalize widget strings
			* the form with enum {lotsa string_ids} is not used anymore (?)
			* copy-paste code doesn't use this consistently either (?)

	? does tmpl rplcmt succeed if the action is to just remove some wagons but there is not enough money for a fully new train

	- when a train is to be extended by adding only a wagon (e.g.), it seems like the cost for a completely new train are
		considered, instead of only the actual update cost, this doesn't make sense
